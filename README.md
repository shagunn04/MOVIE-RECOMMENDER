# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A machine learning-based *Movie Recommendation System* that uses *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* and *clustering techniques* to suggest similar movies to users based on their preferences or selected titles.

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 *Content-based Filtering* using KNN
- 🧠 *Clustering* of similar movies using KMeans
- 🎯 Personalized movie recommendations
- 📊 Based on genres, ratings, popularity, and other metadata
- 🧹 Clean and scalable code structure for further improvements

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KNeighborsClassifier, KMeans)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional: for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (if there's a UI)

## 📁 Dataset

You can use any of the following:
- [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

Make sure the dataset includes features like:
- Movie title
- Genre
- Keywords
- Ratings
- Popularity / Vote Count

## 🧠 How It Works

1. *Preprocessing*: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and extract relevant features.
2. *Feature Vectorization*: Use TF-IDF or CountVectorizer on text data (like genres and keywords).
3. *Clustering*: Group similar movies using KMeans (optional).
4. *KNN Algorithm*: For a given movie, find its top-N nearest neighbors in the feature space.
5. *Recommendation*: Return the most similar movies.
